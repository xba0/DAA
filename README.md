# DAA
[EMNLP 2023 ] Automatic Evaluation of Dialogue Appropriateness Using Dialogue Act

# Abstract
we introduce Dialogue Act Appropriateness (DAA), a novel method that utilizes the underlying patterns of dialogue act transitions to evaluate the appropriateness of chatbot responses.
These transition patterns are learned from a corpus of human-human dialogues. We then evaluate the appropriateness of the chatbot's dialogue act patterns in human-chatbot dialogues by measuring their similarity to the learned patterns and assign appropriateness scores accordingly.
